2012-04-15 (4th release on CRAN)

- fixed bug in check_R_code() that caused removal of quoted sections of a line
  of code to remove too much; fixed other bug causing false reports of missing
  space between operators; fixed third bug causing false reports of wrong
  character after bracket or parentheses

- fixed bug in 'repair_S4_docu.rb' script that caused a wrong error message if
  documentation files were not found

- fixed bug in 'merge.R' that affected the '-c' argument if the merge column
  was numeric

- syntax highlighting for gedit now correctly displays indexing with '$' after
  indexing with brackets

- 'merge.R' now repairs empty column names (which would cause merge() to 
  crash) and reads from STDIN (indicated as file name '-').

- the first argument of mypdf() was renamed

- pack_desc(..., "source") now suppresses package startup messages

- check_R_code() gets a 'three.dots' argument, and the 'docu.R' script an
  according '--dotsok/-D' switch

- listing() gets a 'hf.collapse' argument and more options in the 'last.sep' 
  argument; 'style' can be run through I() and then causes names and values to
  be swapped

- listing.default() now deals with a greater variety of objects

- added (trivial) default method for flatten()


2012-12-19 (3rd release on CRAN)

- more robust approach in check_keywords() to find the KEYWORDS.db file (bug
  submitted by Benjamin Hofner)

- pack_desc() now requires all dependencies in 'source' mode

- list method of flatten() moved from opm package to pkgutils

- pack_desc() gets an 'envir' argument

- check_R_code() gets new 'encoding', 'what' and 'accept.tabs' arguments and
  a check for the usage of ':::'

- the 'style' argument of listing() can now be also set to 'm4' or 'M4'

- pkg_files() now uses 'winslash = "/"' in 'installed = TRUE' mode

- 'docu.R' now also checks test files and scripts if located within
  inst/scripts, inst/tests, scripts or tests
  
- 'docu.R' now also copies hidden files (such as '.Rbuildignore') if requested

- 'docu.R' now updates the DESCRIPTION of an input directory, too, if it is 
  distinct from the output directory

- the '-g' argument of 'docu.R' is replaced by '-G' to omit Rscript's buggy
  warning message; the '--s4methods' argument is renamed to '--S4methods'

- 'docu.R' gets new switches '-B'/'--buildopts', '-I'/'--installopts',
  '-F'/'--folder', '-E'/'--encoding', '-T'/'--tabs' and '-S'/'--Sweave'; the
  'sweave.R' script is removed accordingly

- in 'docu.R', the default behaviour of '-y'/'--yes' is changed (restored by
  applying '-F'/'--folder')

- 'merge.R' now better preserves input row order (if requested)

- 'merge.R' gets a '-e'/'--encoding' argument

- syntax highlighting for gedit now matches dollar operators followed or
  preceded by backquoted names


2012-10-12 (2nd release on CRAN)

- novel listing() function (moved here from opm to pkgutils and made
  generic)

- novel max_rgb_contrast() function (moved here from opm to pkgutils and made
  generic)

- mypdf() made generic

- improved documentation of paper_size() and logfile()

- integrated 'check_code.R' into 'docu.R' script

- expanded command-line arguments of 'docu.R' script

- removed duplicate example dataset ("xyplot_docu" in addition to 
  "xyplot.docu")

- included check for '=' at end of line in check_R_code(), as well as
  checks for closing parentheses or brackets preceded by space; result now 
  returned invisibly (better for interactive checking)

- problem messages from check_R_code() set to singular throughout

- 'merge.R' gains options for dealing with files without headers, for
  deleting non-matching columns of the first file, and for turning sorting
  of columns off
